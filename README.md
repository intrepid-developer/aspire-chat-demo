# Aspire Chat Demo

A modern, real-time chat application built with .NET Aspire and Azure, designed to demonstrate cloud-native application development patterns. This project is part of a blog series exploring how to leverage .NET Aspire with Azure services.

## üåü Overview

This chat application showcases the power of .NET Aspire to simplify building distributed, cloud-native applications. It demonstrates how to integrate various Azure services with a modern .NET stack to create a scalable, resilient real-time application.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a microservices-inspired architecture with:

- **API Backend**: FastEndpoints-based API handling chat messages and user data
- **Web Frontend**: Blazor Server application providing the user interface
- **Infrastructure**: Redis for caching and pub/sub, SQL Server for data persistence, and Azure Storage for file attachments

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **.NET Aspire**: Cloud-ready stack for building observable, production-ready distributed applications
- **FastEndpoints**: High-performance API framework that promotes REPR pattern (Request-Endpoint-Response)
- **Blazor Server**: Interactive web UI framework using C# instead of JavaScript
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for data access and database operations
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching and pub/sub messaging
- **Azure SQL Database**: Managed relational database service
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Scalable object storage for images and file attachments
- **Azure Container Apps**: Hosting environment for containerized applications

## üìä Project Structure

- **AspireChat.AppHost**: Orchestrates all services and infrastructure components
- **AspireChat.Api**: Backend API service using FastEndpoints
- **AspireChat.Web**: Blazor Server frontend application
- **AspireChat.ServiceDefaults**: Shared service configuration and defaults
