WIP BLOG NOT LIVE YET, SUBJECT TO CHANGE

# Aspire Chat Demo

A modern, real-time chat application built with .NET Aspire and Azure, designed to demonstrate cloud-native application development patterns. This project is part of a blog series exploring how to leverage .NET Aspire with Azure services.

## üåü Overview

This chat application showcases the power of .NET Aspire to simplify building distributed, cloud-native applications. It demonstrates how to integrate various Azure services with a modern .NET stack to create a scalable, resilient real-time application.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a microservices-inspired architecture with:

- **API Backend**: FastEndpoints-based API handling chat messages and user data
- **Web Frontend**: Blazor Server application providing the user interface
- **Infrastructure**: Redis for caching and pub/sub, SQL Server for data persistence, and Azure Storage for file attachments

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **.NET Aspire**: Cloud-ready stack for building observable, production-ready distributed applications
- **FastEndpoints**: High-performance API framework that promotes REPR pattern (Request-Endpoint-Response)
- **Blazor Server**: Interactive web UI framework using C# instead of JavaScript
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for data access and database operations
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching and pub/sub messaging
- **Azure SQL Database**: Managed relational database service
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Scalable object storage for images and file attachments
- **Azure Container Apps**: Hosting environment for containerized applications

## üìä Project Structure

- **AspireChat.AppHost**: Orchestrates all services and infrastructure components
- **AspireChat.Api**: Backend API service using FastEndpoints
- **AspireChat.Web**: Blazor Server frontend application
- **AspireChat.ServiceDefaults**: Shared service configuration and defaults

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK
- Docker Desktop
- Visual Studio 2022 or later / VS Code with C# Dev Kit
- Azure subscription (for deployment)
- Aspire Cli

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aspire-chat-demo.git
   cd aspire-chat-demo
   ```

2. Install the Aspire Cli
    ```
    dotnet tool install --global aspire.cli --prerelease
    ```
3. Run the application with Aspire dashboard (from the AppHost directory):
   ```
   aspire run
   ```

4Navigate to the Aspire dashboard (automatically opened) to view and manage your services

### Deployment to Azure

The blog series will cover step-by-step deployment to Azure using:
- Azure Container Apps for hosting services
- Azure SQL Database for data persistence
- Redis Cache (docker)
- Azure Blob Storage for file storage
